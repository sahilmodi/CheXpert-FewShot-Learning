# Comparative study of few-shot learning methods on CheXpert 

Run `sh utils/prepare_data.sh <path to directory which will store chexpert>` to download and prepare the dataset.
- Example: `sh utils/prepare_data.sh ../data/` will store CheXpert in `../data/CheXpert-v1.0-small/`. 
- Not recommended to keep CheXpert in git repo because VSCode slows down.
